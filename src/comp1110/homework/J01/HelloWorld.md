You will be asked to answer the following question:

* Within the `comp1110.homework.J01` package of the `comp1110-homework` project,
  create a class a called `HelloWorld` (you should add the file to git when prompted).
This should appear as a file `HelloWorld` within a package `comp1110.homework.J01`.
This detail is important because the tests assume that your work appears in
exactly this location.
* Navigate to your `HelloWorld` class, and modify it so that its main
 method prints `Hello world!`.
* Test your `HelloWorld` class by selecting the `J01` option in the
  drop-down next to green arrow.
* Once your `HelloWorld` class passes the tests, commit it to your git repo.
